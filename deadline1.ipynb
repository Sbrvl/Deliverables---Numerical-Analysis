    "\n",
    "The Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov (KPP) equation, also known as the Fisher-KPP equation, appears in various scientific and engineering contexts, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Population Genetics and Ecology**: Originally introduced to describe gene frequency propagation in spatially distributed populations, capturing how advantageous genes spread through a habitat. ([Fisher, 1937](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1937.tb02153.x)).\n",
    "- **Reaction-Diffusion Systems**: Used in modeling chemical and biological fronts where substances or species diffuse and react, leading to traveling wave solutions. ([Contri, 2018](https://www.aimsciences.org/article/doi/10.3934/nhm.2018006)).\n",
    "- **Combustion Theory**: Appears in the study of flame propagation in premixed gases, where heat and reactants diffuse while undergoing exothermic reactions. ([Zeldovich & Frank-Kamenetskii, 1938](https://doi.org/10.1088/0959-5309/53/4/301)).\n",
    "- **Neuroscience**: Models the propagation of action potentials in nerve fibers, describing the dynamics of neural excitation and signal transmission. ([Corti et al., 2023](https://www.mate.polimi.it/biblioteca/add/qmox/41-2023.pdf)).\n",
    "- **Epidemiology**: Describes how infectious diseases spread spatially in a population, illustrating how diseases can propagate over geographical areas. ([Murray, 2002](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-08539-4)).\n",

    "- $\\beta \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}$ models diffusion (e.g., random dispersal in ecology, chemical diffusion coefficients in reaction-diffusion systems, thermal diffusivity in combustion, electrical conductivity in neuroscience, population mixing in epidemiology).\n",
    "- $f$ represents external forcing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Derivations vary depending on the application but often involve combining **reaction kinetics with Fickâ€™s law of diffusion**.\n",
