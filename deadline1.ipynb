    "## (a) In which contexts does the KPP equation arise?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov (KPP) equation, also known as the Fisher-KPP equation, appears in various scientific and engineering contexts, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Population Genetics and Ecology**: Originally introduced to describe gene frequency propagation in spatially distributed populations, capturing how advantageous genes spread through a habitat. ([Fisher, 1937](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1937.tb02153.x)).\n",
    "- **Reaction-Diffusion Systems**: Used in modeling chemical and biological fronts where substances or species diffuse and react, leading to traveling wave solutions. ([Embree, 2001](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/pdectb/fisher2.pdf)).\n",
    "- **Combustion Theory**: Appears in the study of flame propagation in premixed gases, where heat and reactants diffuse while undergoing exothermic reactions. ([Zeldovich & Frank-Kamenetskii, 1938](https://doi.org/10.1088/0959-5309/53/4/301)).\n",
    "- **Neuroscience**: Models the propagation of action potentials in nerve fibers, describing the dynamics of neural excitation and signal transmission. ([Corti et al., 2023](https://www.mate.polimi.it/biblioteca/add/qmox/41-2023.pdf)).\n",
    "- **Epidemiology**: Describes how infectious diseases spread spatially in a population, illustrating how diseases can propagate over geographical areas. ([Murray, 2002](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-08539-4)).\n",

    "- $\\beta \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}$ models diffusion.\n",
    "- $f$ represents external forcing.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- **In Population Genetics**: The equation arises from a **diffusion model of gene frequencies**, originally formulated by Fisher and later extended by Kolmogorov, Petrovskii, and Piskunov.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **In Chemical and Biological Reaction-Diffusion Systems**: The equation is derived using **Fickâ€™s Law of Diffusion** and reaction kinetics, leading to a **nonlinear PDE** describing how a substance spreads while reacting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **In Combustion Theory**: The derivation involves **heat conduction equations coupled with chemical reaction rates**, where the reaction-diffusion form naturally emerges in **flame propagation**.\n",

    "- **In Neuroscience**: The equation models **wave propagation of neural action potentials**, and it can be derived from **Hodgkin-Huxley-type models** under certain simplifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **In Epidemiology**: The KPP equation emerges in **disease spread models**, particularly in spatially dependent **SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) models** with diffusion.\n",
