    "\n",
    "1. **ODE or PDE?**  \n",
    "   - Since the equation involves only the time derivative $ \\partial_t u $ and no spatial derivatives, it is an **ordinary differential equation (ODE)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Linearity:**  \n",
    "   - The function $ F(u) $ is nonlinear in $ u $, making the equation **nonlinear**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Homogeneity:**  \n",
    "   - The equation has a second member that is non-zero, therefore the equations is not homogeneous. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Autonomous or Non-Autonomous?**  \n",
    "   - The right-hand side, $ \\alpha F(u) $, does not explicitly depend on t, meaning the system is **autonomous**.\n"
